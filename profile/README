[Bleu](https://bleu.com) is the web3 development partner for companies and DAOs, dedicated to making blockchain interactions simple and user-friendly. Our mission is to bridge the gap between blockchain's potential and current user interfaces, helping onboard the next billion users to blockchain.

We specialize in:

- **User-facing web3 app development**: Building responsive, user-friendly interfaces with Next.js, connected to smart contracts, often using backend solutions like Ponder and Subgraphs for data indexing.
- **Prototyping and UI/UX Design**: Developing interactive prototypes for feedback and iteration, and crafting intuitive, accessible interfaces tailored to each project's target audience.

This GitHub Organization hosts Bleu's open-source projects, designs, and experimental code.

Among our current and past projects:

- **Optimism Tech Partner**: Supporting teams with innovative smart contracts, from initial prototyping and design to backend development and data analytics.
- **CoW Stoploss**: Enabling non-technical users to create stop-loss orders within the CoW protocol.
- **Balancer Pool Simulator**: Empowering pool owners to enhance their pools with metadata for better user understanding.
